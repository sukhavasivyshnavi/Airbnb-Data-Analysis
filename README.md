# Airbnb Data Analysis using Python

This project involves exploratory data analysis on Airbnb listings using Python. It focuses on identifying patterns and deriving insights related to room types, pricing, reviews, and geographic distribution. The analysis is performed using Python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from Airbnb listing data by addressing the following questions:
- What are the most common types of rooms available?
- Which neighborhoods have the highest number of listings?
- How do prices vary by room type and location?
- What patterns exist in the number of reviews per month?

## Key Insights

1. **Room Type Distribution**  
   Private rooms constitute the majority of listings, followed by entire homes and shared rooms.

2. **Listings by Neighborhood**  
   Manhattan has the highest number of listings and the highest average prices, while Staten Island has the fewest.

3. **Price Distribution**  
   Most listings are priced between $50 and $300. Listings priced above $1000 were treated as outliers and excluded from the main analysis.

4. **Average Price by Room Type**  
   Entire homes tend to be the most expensive on average, followed by private rooms.

5. **Reviews per Month by Room Type**  
   Shared rooms generally receive fewer reviews. Entire homes and private rooms show higher engagement based on monthly reviews.

6. **Geographical Distribution**  
   Manhattan and Brooklyn exhibit a high concentration of listings. Prices are influenced by proximity to tourist and central areas.
